## B
**[Bloom Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter)**: A space-efficient algorithm and data structure used to verify whether an element is a member of a set. There may be false positive matches but false negatives are not positive.

**Cron**: A software utility that is used to schedule periodical time based jobs in Unix like operating systems. Cron jobs are written in shell script and stored with other instructions to daemons.

## D

**Daemon**: A computer program that runs as a background process.

**Dynamic Typing**: Languages that check for type correctness during runtime. Type errors will not be brought up at compile time (if applicable).

## P

**Parametric Polymorphism**: The ability to define a general function that acts on various different types, while maintaing static type safety.


**Polymorphism** (OOP): The ability to have the same interface (ie. arithmetic operators, functions) for different objects and data types.

## S

**[SAML](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/saml_about.htm)**: (Security Assertion Markup Language) is a standard for exchanging authentication information between a service provider and an identity provider. An example would be using Google (identity provider) auth to sign in for a private project (service provider). 

**Serialization**: The process of converting an object or data structure to a format that allows for it to be stored (in a file, database ... etc).

**Static Typing**: Languages that check for type correctness during compile time. These languages are less likely to have runtime type errors.

## T

**Type Inference**: Automatic deduction of the data type of an expression in a programming language. (Wikipedia)
