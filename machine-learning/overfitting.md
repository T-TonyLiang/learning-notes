# The Problem of Overfitting

### What is overfitting?
Overfitting (or high variance) is a result of having too many features (ex. high order polynomial). The learned hypothesis may fit the training examples very well (J(&theta;) ~ 0) but fail to generalize to new examples.

#### Underfitting
On the other hand, underfitting is a result of having too little features such that the hypothesis fits the data poorly and also fail to create meaningful and useful predictions.
