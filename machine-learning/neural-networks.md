# Neural Networks
Another learning algorithm with its goal of mimicing the brain. It was widely used in the 80's and 90's and died down in the late 90s. It is now becoming popular as hardware is fast enough to perform large scale neural network calculations.
It was developed as simulating neurons or networks of neurons in the brain.
